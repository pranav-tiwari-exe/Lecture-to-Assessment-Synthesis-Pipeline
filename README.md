# Lecture-to-Assessment Synthesis Pipeline

## Overview

The **Lecture-to-Assessment Synthesis Pipeline** is an academic team project designed to automatically convert lecture content into structured assessments using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

The objective of this project is to reduce manual effort for educators by automating assessment generation and enabling scalable, intelligent learning workflows. The system is built with a modular architecture, separating machine learning, backend, and frontend components.

## Key Features

* Automatic generation of assessment questions from lecture content
* NLP-based text processing and analysis
* Modular and extensible architecture
* Clear separation of ML, backend, and frontend responsibilities

---

## Tech Stack

### Backend

* Node.js
* Express.js (REST API layer)

## My Contribution

I contributed to this project as part of a collaborative team. My responsibilities included:

* Backend integration and feature development
* Supporting interaction between the NLP pipeline and backend APIs
* Debugging, testing, and improving overall system flow
* Collaborating with team members to understand and extend existing codebases

This experience strengthened my understanding of working in a team environment and contributing effectively to a modular, real-world project.

## How to Run (High-Level)

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the Python environment and install required dependencies
3. Start the backend server
4. Run the frontend application
5. Use the interface to process lecture content and generate assessments

Note: Detailed setup steps may vary depending on environment and configuration.
